# resume_jd_matching_streamlit_app
This project is a Streamlit app where users upload a PDF resume and input a job description to compare their skills. The app extracts and cleans skills from both documents, then uses BERT-based semantic similarity to determine a match. Results are visualized with a pie chart showing the matching score and skill matches.
